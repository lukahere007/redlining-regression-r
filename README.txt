- Racial minority percentage
- Fire and theft rates
- Housing age
- Median family income

## 🔧 Methods
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model building & variable selection
- Diagnostic checks (linearity, normality, homoscedasticity)
- Model validation (PRESS, LOOCV)

- `report.html`: Rendered report
- `data/`: Dataset used in the project
- `scripts/`: Custom helper functions
